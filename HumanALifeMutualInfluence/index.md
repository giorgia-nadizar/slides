# Humans and ALife?

Much more than a Tamagotchi!

- Do artificial agents react to the actions of humans, displaying short-term adaptation in response to stimuli?
- Do these actions influence the inherited traits of artificial creatures, steering their evolutionary path and long-term adaptation?

- Are humans aware of their influence on ALife?
- Do they shift their conduct accordingly?
